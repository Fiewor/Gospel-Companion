      "The steps of creation day by day are most wonderful. God's great purpose was to provide this world for man. In order that man should be sustained here in life, it was necessary that the earth be prepared for the creating of life. The successive creative acts reveal great wisdom and order. God first brought into being the earth, which was without form and void, and darkness was upon the face of the deep. His next act was to command light; for light and the heat, which attends it are essential to human life. He then created the firmament -- the expanse above the earth, modifying the temperature and separating the vaporous waters above (the clouds) from the condensed waters below (the seas). Thus the seas, the atmosphere, and the clouds made perfect provision for life upon the land. Grass, fruits, and herbs were then the next creative act, each with seed after its kind. The geographers tell us that the surface of the earth consists of two thirds water and one third land. At the regular rate of evaporation of the seas, which has been carefully measured, it is found that this proportion is a perfect balance essential to provide moisture for life upon the land. Such is the wisdom of our God. He added to this the sun to rule by day, and the moon to rule by night, besides the planets of our solar system, and the innumerable stars, which sparkle like diamonds in the heavens. \"Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God\" [HEB:11:3]).\n",
