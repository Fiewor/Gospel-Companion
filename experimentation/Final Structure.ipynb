It has been observed by all true Christians from that time down to the present day. The Bible also mentions keeping the Sabbath day holy, which is the seventh day of the week, but it is important to note that the Sabbath day was given specifically to the Children of Israel, and the first day of the week, Sunday, became accepted as the day of worship immediately after Jesus' resurrection.

All the blood that had been shed in sacrifices, all the temple ceremonies that the Israelites observed as part of the Law, pointed in one way or another to the time when Jesus would come and shed His Blood for our salvation.

With their offerings, they were supposed to pray from their heart, and believe in Him who was to come. But too many times they did not pray from the heart. They killed the animals and held special feasts for their own pleasures. One time in their history, God startled them by crying against them: \"I am full of the burnt offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood of bullocks, or of lambs, or of he goats. . . . Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth. . . . When ye make many prayers, I will not hear\" (Isaiah 1:11-15).\n",

There were times when the Children of Israel were captives and could not worship in the Temple as God had directed. There were times when there was no Temple, which was their church, for, it had been destroyed by enemies.

These sacrifices were meant to show the people in Old Testament times that Jesus would some day come to shed His Blood to redeem mankind from sin. The animals that were offered as sacrifices under the Law represented Jesus' coming to die for our sins, shedding His Blood on the Cross of Calvary to make atonement for the people. However, when Jesus died on Calvary, He had fulfilled all the sacrificial laws, and there was no more need for the Jews to keep them.\n"
