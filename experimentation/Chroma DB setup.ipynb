As it cooled off and slowed down it became the earth. Neither do these men tell of the origin of the sun; but the Bible tells us that God said, \"Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven\" (Genesis 1: 14), and \"God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day\" (Genesis 1: 16).\n",

      "That was not the only message Gabriel had to tell. Five months later he came to earth again. This time he appeared to a young Jewish maiden who was of the tribe of Judah. And what a message he had to give to her! She was to become the mother of the Messiah! Every Jewish girl, through the long, weary years of waiting for God's promise to be fulfilled, had hoped that she might be the mother of Israel's King who would sit upon the throne of David. This honour was now granted to Mary. She was of the kingly lineage of David; but through the centuries of Babylonians captivity and Roman oppression, the royal splendour of Israel had faded. Our Lord's mother had no fortune nor fame of this world, but she was rich toward God. She had lived to please Him; and now the angel told her: \"Hail, thou that art highly favoured, the Lord is with thee: blessed art thou among women.... thou hast found favour with God.\"\n",

Mary seemed to lose sight of everything else but her chance to receive teachings from the Great Teacher.\n",
