As it cooled off and slowed down it became the earth. Neither do these men tell of the origin of the sun; but the Bible tells us that God said, \"Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven\" (Genesis 1: 14), and \"God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day\" (Genesis 1: 16).\n",

Yet, on the other hand, if the plants had lived many years without the animals and man to eat them and keep them in control, the earth would have been covered with a tangle of plants.

      "One more instruction given in this lesson is to keep the Sabbath Day holy. One of the Ten Commandments given to the Children of Israel many years before the time of Isaiah was: \"Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy\" [EXO:20:8]). The first day of the week became accepted as the day of worship immediately after Jesus' resurrection, and has been observed by all true Christians from that time down to the present day. It is the day on which Jesus rose from the dead; it is the day on which he made His appearances to the disciples; it is the day on which the Holy Ghost was given, when the true Church was founded; it is the day on which the disciples met to break bread in commemoration of the Lord's Supper, and brought their offerings to the Lord.\n",

The Lord gave His approval of the first day by blessing His people who worshiped on Sunday and by sending His Spirit on the first day of the week upon those who were praying in an upper room on the Day of Pentecost, fifty days after Christ's resurrection.

The Bible teaches that those who sin are not God's people, because \"whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin\" (John 8:34).  We read that \"whoso confesseth and forsaketh\" his sins \"shall have mercy\" (Proverbs 28:13).  We read:  \"If we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin\" (I John 1:7).

      "The Sacrifices Fulfilled\n",
      "\n",
      "The Book of Hebrews was written by the Apostle Paul to the Hebrew Christians, those who had believed on Jesus. They had been brought up to obey the Law of Moses, and they knew all about the sacrifices that should be made. But those sacrifices had been given as pictures to show the people in Old Testament times that Jesus would some day come to shed His Blood to redeem mankind from sin. When Jesus came, He did just as the sacrifices had pictured: He was crucified on Calvary, shedding His Blood. After that there was no need to sacrifice any more animals.\n",

      "\n",
      "The people who repent of their sins and give their heart to the Lord are born again, born into a new life. The Bible tells us that when one becomes a Christian he is a \"new creature\" [2CO:5:17]). Paul also called the new Christians \"babes in Christ\" [1CO:3:1]). They have just started in the Christian way and are not expected to know all there is to know about Christianity.\n",

      "Starting as a Baby\n",
      "\n",
      "We do not hold it against a man that he was once a baby; everyone gets his start in life as a baby. But no one stays a baby very long. Some babies may get a disease that will stunt their growth, and they become midgets. Or some other sickness may keep some from walking, so they remain invalids all their life. But those things are tragedies that everyone hopes to avoid.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hard Places\n",
      "\n",
      "Paul gives some instructions in Hebrews 12 and 13 on how we can be prepared to meet Jesus, so we can escape all the judgment. Perhaps we have been saved and served God faithfully for a while, but as time goes by and Jesus does not come, some may become careless or tired of serving God. They think they have so many trials or hard places, they wonder if it pays. Remember that Jesus had some hard places, too. Most people rejected Him, did not love Him; and eventually He had to die on the cross. We have never had to suffer anything as bad as what Jesus suffered for us. That should encourage everyone to hold fast until Jesus comes.\n",
