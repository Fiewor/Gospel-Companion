One of the Ten Commandments given to the Children of Israel many years before the time of Isaiah was: \"Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy\" [EXO:20:8]). The first day of the week became accepted as the day of worship immediately after Jesus' resurrection, and has been observed by all true Christians from that time down to the present day. It is the day on which Jesus rose from the dead; it is the day on which he made His appearances to the disciples; it is the day on which the Holy Ghost was given, when the true Church was founded; it is the day on which the disciples met to break bread in commemoration of the Lord's Supper, and brought their offerings to the Lord.\n",

The disciples met on Sunday to break bread together [ACT:20:7]) and to bring their offerings unto the Lord [1CO:16:2]). The Lord gave His approval of the first day by blessing His people who worshiped on Sunday and by sending His Spirit on the first day of the week upon those who were praying in an upper room on the Day of Pentecost, fifty days after Christ's resurrection. It was accepted as the day of worship immediately after the resurrection of Christ and has been observed by all true Christians from that time down to the present day.\n",

Perhaps we have been saved and served God faithfully for a while, but as time goes by and Jesus does not come, some may become careless or tired of serving God. They think they have so many trials or hard places, they wonder if it pays. Remember that Jesus had some hard places, too. Most people rejected Him, did not love Him; and eventually He had to die on the cross. We have never had to suffer anything as bad as what Jesus suffered for us. That should encourage everyone to hold fast until Jesus comes.\n",

As it cooled off and slowed down it became the earth. Neither do these men tell of the origin of the sun; but the Bible tells us that God said, \"Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven\" (Genesis 1: 14), and \"God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day\" (Genesis 1: 16).\n",

How could such a teaching be correct? The plants would not have lived in a long period of darkness. Yet, on the other hand, if the plants had lived many years without the animals and man to eat them and keep them in control, the earth would have been covered with a tangle of plants.

It is the day on which Jesus rose from the dead; it is the day on which he made His appearances to the disciples; it is the day on which the Holy Ghost was given, when the true Church was founded; it is the day on which the disciples met to break bread in commemoration of the Lord's Supper, and brought their offerings to the Lord.\n",

The Lord gave His approval of the first day by blessing His people who worshiped on Sunday and by sending His Spirit on the first day of the week upon those who were praying in an upper room on the Day of Pentecost, fifty days after Christ's resurrection.

The Scripture states: \"All have sinned, and come short of the glory of God\" (Romans 3:23). A man remains a sinner until He comes to Jesus in repentance and asks for forgiveness, reminding God that Jesus shed His Blood in order that \"whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life\" (John 3:16).

He is \"quickened\" to life, and is no longer a child of disobedience. When one is born again and has Jesus in his heart, he does not sin any more ([1JN:3:9]). He is delivered from the power of Satan ([1JN:5:18]). Jesus came to destroy the work of Satan, and to help people -\" \"to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith\" [ACT:26:18]).\n",

We did not see the Spirit of God come in, or the devil go out, but we can certainly see the change.\n",

      "It may be that someone has a bad temper. He gets angry when he cannot have his way.  After he is saved his friends notice that he does not get angry any more, and he is not quarrelsome. That is one of the results of the new birth, just as real as the tree being uprooted by the wind.\n",

      "When Adam sinned in the Garden of Eden, he brought God's condemnation upon all men. The nature of sin which came upon Adam when he disobeyed God was passed on to his children, and grandchildren, and on to this present generation. It is natural for a child to do wrong from the time he is born. God does not hold him accountable so long as he does not know better; and if a child dies before he knows the difference between right and wrong, Jesus will take him to Heaven even though he has not prayed for forgiveness. But when a person grows older and knows that he does things he should not do, he must ask Jesus to forgive him if he wants to go to Heaven. When we ask Jesus to forgive our sins, He saves us and we are born again. Our sins are washed away, forgiven and forgotten by God.

And is this correct according to the bible as soon groups still say that the Sabbath day, as in the day for worship, Saturday.\\nAI: According to the Junior Sunday School lessons, Christians worship on Sunday because it is the day on which Jesus rose from the dead, the day on which he made His appearances to the disciples, the day on which the Holy Ghost was given, and the day on which the disciples met to break bread in commemoration of the Lord\\'s Supper and brought their offerings to the Lord. It has been observed by all true Christians from that time down to the present day. The Bible also mentions keeping the Sabbath day holy, which is the seventh day of the week, but it is important to note that the Sabbath day was given specifically to the Children of Israel, and the first day of the week, Sunday, became accepted as the day of worship immediately after Jesus\\' resurrection.

Unless a person lives for Jesus and does not permit sin to enter their life, they will lose their right to eternal life. The scripture in Ezekiel 18:26 states, \"When a righteous man turneth away from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, and dieth in them; for his iniquity that he hath done shall he die.\" In order to be ready to go to Heaven, old things must pass away and the sinful nature must be purged, and all things must become new in our lives. Therefore, it is not possible for a person to continue in sin and still remain born again.\\nHuman: What can you tell me about the book of Hebrews that a new Christian should know?\\nAI: The book of Hebrews was written by the Apostle Paul to the Hebrew Christians, those who had believed on Jesus. They had been brought up to obey the Law of Moses, and they knew all about the sacrifices that should be made. But those sacrifices had been given as pictures to show the people in Old Testament times that Jesus would some day come to shed His Blood to redeem mankind from sin. When Jesus came, He did just as the sacrifices had pictured: He was crucified on Calvary, shedding His Blood. After that there was no need to sacrifice any more animals.

      "The steps of creation day by day are most wonderful. God's great purpose was to provide this world for man. In order that man should be sustained here in life, it was necessary that the earth be prepared for the creating of life. The successive creative acts reveal great wisdom and order. God first brought into being the earth, which was without form and void, and darkness was upon the face of the deep. His next act was to command light; for light and the heat, which attends it are essential to human life. He then created the firmament -- the expanse above the earth, modifying the temperature and separating the vaporous waters above (the clouds) from the condensed waters below (the seas). Thus the seas, the atmosphere, and the clouds made perfect provision for life upon the land. Grass, fruits, and herbs were then the next creative act, each with seed after its kind. The geographers tell us that the surface of the earth consists of two thirds water and one third land. At the regular\n",

      "In the Ten Commandments we are told to \"remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.\" Many people are seeking to accuse us regarding our observance of the Christian Sabbath, the first day of the week; but the fact that Jesus has honoured and blessed that day by His resurrection and His post-resurrection appearances to the assembled disciples, along with the fact that His Holy Spirit has been pleased to put His seal upon it as the day of worship during the 1900 years since that time, is enough to convince every honest inquirer after truth that Sunday is the day that God has chosen.  The Jewish Sabbath has nothing to do with the Christian church, nor has the Christian church anything to do with the Jewish Sabbath.  The Jewish Sabbath is an institution of the Law in connection with Israel.  The great documents addressed to the Christian church, the Epistles, never mention the Jewish Sabbath once, nor is there anywhere in the Epistles an exhortation to keep the Jewish Sabbath\n",
      "\n",
      "The Christian is not under the bondage of force to keep the Lord's Day, the first day of the week, sanctified to the Lord; but he does so as a token of his love for God and in recognition of his moral obligation to God. The Christian desires to be drawn closer to the Lord, through the medium of worship, and the sanctifying of the first day of the week unto God is his greatest pleasures.\n",

      "\n",
      "The old Sabbath, which some who teach much false doctrine declare was instituted as a memorial of creation, was no longer observed by the Christians. The apostles and disciples continued to go into the synagogues on the Jewish Sabbath day that they might use that opportunity to make contact with the Jews assembled there to tell them of Jesus and His power to save ([ACT:14:1]). But the first day of the week became the day of their worship and they kept it, as we do today, as a memorial of the New Creation under the dispensation of grace -- the completion of that stage of the plan of our redemption when Jesus arose from the dead and proved His power over death and Satan.\n",
      "\n",
      "Christians observe Sunday, the first day of the week, as the Lord's Day. The first day of the week was the day on which Jesus rose; it was the day on which he made His several appearances before His disciples after His resurrection; it was the day on which the power fell [ACT:2:1-47]), at which time Christ's Church was founded; it was the day on which the disciples met to break bread in commemoration of the Lord's Supper, and it was the day on which they brought their offerings to the Lord. True Christians throughout the centuries since Jesus' resurrection have felt that the first day of the week is God's chosen day in the new dispensation, and they have added to their true spiritual wealth as they have observed that day in the spirit of the above instructions of God to Israel. Those who refuse to observe the Lord's Day have robbed themselves of spiritual riches that they otherwise would have obtained.\n",

      "No Christian is ever found in the places of sin on Sunday or any other day, but a special reverence and regard should be placed upon the Lord's Day.  As the Lord's Day, it should be spent in worshiping and honouring God, our Creator, and Jesus Christ, the Lord of the Sabbath and the One Whose resurrection from the dead has made possible the new creation.

      "\n",
      "There is a false teaching in the world today that when once one has been born again he is always a child of God and will not be lost eternally regardless of how deep he may go into sin, and though he die in his sins. They call it \"eternal security.\" Some say that people who have once been truly saved and have backslidden will eventually come back to God before they die, though they may wander in sin for a long time. It is true that they may get back to God, but there is danger that they will not. How they can ignore the plain teaching in this lesson is more than one can understand. In [JHN:15:1-6], Christ teaches that the unfruitful branches are cut off and destroyed. Every one of these branches had been attached to the vine at one time.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is possible to be a Christian, to have lived a godly life, and to be a possessor of the eternal life that is given to all who are truly saved, and then to lose that salvation. One need not lose it. One need not stay in that hopeless state if he has lost it. The Scriptures abound in instances where those who once had the salvation of God and had lost it were reinstated into the family of God by praying the prayer of repentance that brought it in the first place.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is true that a child of God does not commit sin. And it is Scripturally true that when such a one does sin he is no longer a child of Cod but is a child of the devil instead. A so-called sinning Christian is no Christian at all, for he bears the image of Satan instead of being a member of the family of God.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the saddest happenings recorded in the Bible is that of a person who has had the knowledge of God and then has returned to the beggarly elements of the world. The examples given of the dog returning to that which made him sick, and the sow that was washed and cleansed returning to wallow in the mire, illustrate the sensuality and disgusting moral filthiness into which these apostates fall.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are many professors of religion today who will take exception to this very strongly worded statement by the Apostle, in showing the possibility of falling from grace. \"Eternal Security\" is the title recently adopted for a false teaching variously known as \"Perseverance of the Saints,\" the \"Preservation of the Saved,\" and \"Once in Grace, Always in Grace.\" We find that a person may be \"in grace\" today, as he obeys God's Word; but if he sins, in disobedience to God's Word, he will be \"in disgrace.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Many think that because we are told that if we sin wilfully after we have received a knowledge of the truth, there is no possibility of returning to the Lord. Correspondents frequently write to our office and want to know if there is a possibility of a man's being renewed if he has fallen away after he has received his experiences, especially the baptism of the Holy Ghost. There certainly is. We know it from personal experience as well as from the Word of God. Therefore this covers something, which does not come under the classification of ordinary sin.\n",
      "\n",
      "No one who values his eternal salvation is going to risk dabbling in sin, expecting to get back to God before he dies. It is possible to be restored to God's favour after having lost the grace of God out of the heart ([1JN:2:1-2]); but should one die in his sins, he will be eternally lost. It is dangerous to trifle with God's love and mercy. \"He that endureth to the end shall be saved\" (Matthew 10:22).\n",

In order that man should be sustained here in life, it was necessary that the earth be prepared for the creating of life. The successive creative acts reveal great wisdom and order. God first brought into being the earth, which was without form and void, and darkness was upon the face of the deep. His next act was to command light; for light and the heat, which attends it are essential to human life. He then created the firmament -- the expanse above the earth, modifying the temperature and separating the vaporous waters above (the clouds) from the condensed waters below (the seas). Thus the seas, the atmosphere, and the clouds made perfect provision for life upon the land. Grass, fruits, and herbs were then the next creative act, each with seed after its kind.

Upon that type was built all the Sabbaths of the entire Israelitish religious program, which God gave them. They had the weekly sabbaths; they had the Sabbath of Weeks that was later called Pentecost. They had the monthly Sabbaths every seventh month, which was the Feast of Tabernacles. They had the Sabbath of years: every seventh year was a year of rest in which the land was to lie idle, and in which there was an adjustment of debts, and in which servants could go free out of their master's house if they chose. Then there was the sabbath of seven years -- that is, every 50th year was a year of jubilee.

True Christians throughout the centuries since Jesus' resurrection have felt that the first day of the week is God's chosen day in the new dispensation, and they have added to their true spiritual wealth as they have observed that day in the spirit of the above instructions of God to Israel.

They call it \"eternal security.\" Some say that people who have once been truly saved and have backslidden will eventually come back to God before they die, though they may wander in sin for a long time. It is true that they may get back to God, but there is danger that they will not. How they can ignore the plain teaching in this lesson is more than one can understand. In [JHN:15:1-6], Christ teaches that the unfruitful branches are cut off and destroyed. Every one of these branches had been attached to the vine at one time.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is possible to be a Christian, to have lived a godly life, and to be a possessor of the eternal life that is given to all who are truly saved, and then to lose that salvation. One need not lose it. One need not stay in that hopeless state if he has lost it. The Scriptures abound in instances where those who once had the salvation of God and had lost it were reinstated into the family of God by praying the prayer of repentance that brought it in the first place.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is true that a child of God does not commit sin. And it is Scripturally true that when such a one does sin he is no longer a child of Cod but is a child of the devil instead. A so-called sinning Christian is no Christian at all, for he bears the image of Satan instead of being a member of the family of God.\n",

      "One of the saddest happenings recorded in the Bible is that of a person who has had the knowledge of God and then has returned to the beggarly elements of the world. The examples given of the dog returning to that which made him sick, and the sow that was washed and cleansed returning to wallow in the mire, illustrate the sensuality and disgusting moral filthiness into which these apostates fall.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are many professors of religion today who will take exception to this very strongly worded statement by the Apostle, in showing the possibility of falling from grace. \"Eternal Security\" is the title recently adopted for a false teaching variously known as \"Perseverance of the Saints,\" the \"Preservation of the Saved,\" and \"Once in Grace, Always in Grace.\" We find that a person may be \"in grace\" today, as he obeys God's Word; but if he sins, in disobedience to God's Word, he will be \"in disgrace.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Many think that because we are told that if we sin wilfully after we have received a knowledge of the truth, there is no possibility of returning to the Lord. Correspondents frequently write to our office and want to know if there is a possibility of a man's being renewed if he has fallen away after he has received his experiences, especially the baptism of the Holy Ghost. There certainly is. We know it from personal experience as well as from the Word of God. Therefore this covers something, which does not come under the classification of ordinary sin.\n",

      "Salvation is a revelation from God, and every soul who has experienced this \"new birth\" will say it is real. If a man be in Christ, he is a \"new creature.\" God regenerates the heart.

      "These false prophets declare that if one is born into the family of God, he is always a son.  No matter what happens or how deep in sin he may go, he is always a son even though a prodigal son and that some day he will return home. They fail to consider the Bible teaching that a son can be disinherited, and that sin unrepented of will separate a soul from God eternally. There are many passages of Scripture counteracting this false doc-trine, but one found in Ezekiel is sufficient. \"When the righteous turneth away from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, and doeth according to all the abominations that the wicked man doeth. shall he live? All his righteousness that he hath done shall not be mentioned: in his trespass that he hath trespassed, and in his sin that he hath sinned, in them shall he die\" (Ezekiel 18:24).\n",

This is because it was the day on which Jesus rose from the dead and made His several appearances before His disciples after His resurrection. It was also the day on which the power fell (Acts 2:1-47), at which time Christ's Church was founded, and the day on which the disciples met to break bread in commemoration of the Lord's Supper and brought their offerings to the Lord. True Christians throughout the centuries since Jesus' resurrection have felt that the first day of the week is God's chosen day in the new dispensation, and they have observed that day in the spirit of the above instructions of God to Israel. The Jewish Sabbath has nothing to do with the Christian church, nor has the Christian church anything to do with the Jewish Sabbath. The great documents addressed to the Christian church, the Epistles, never mention the Jewish Sabbath once, nor is there anywhere in the Epistles an exhortation to keep the Jewish Sabbath.

Jesus was very much displeased at this. So he overthrew the tables of the money-changers and the seats of those who sold doves.

Then Jesus told the man, Nicodemus, that every man must be saved or he could not go to Heaven. The man did not know what that meant, so perhaps Jesus explained that one must be sorry that one ever did such wrong things as stealing, lying, swearing, getting angry, hating people, and many other bad things. He said that those who did such things must ask God to forgive them; then He washes the heart and makes it white and clean.\n",

      "Did you ever see a little baby become angry and scream and cry when something did not please him? He is born with that nature within him and he cannot help it. Every child born into the world has a sinful heart. Then as he grows older he may say naughty words. Soon he disobeys his parents; and when he goes to school, perhaps he takes things which belong to others, or is unkind to his playmates. But his parents teach him to pray, and take him to Sunday School. He learns that he must be saved. When he prays and asks Jesus to forgive his sins, Jesus saves him. How happy he is now! He asks his mother to forgive him for being naughty. He takes back the things he stole. He does not commit sin.\n",

      "But he needs to be sanctified wholly, for he still has that same nature or disposition within him with which he was born. Of course, he lives a good life every day, for he prays and asks Jesus to keep him from sin. He does not get angry when things go wrong, but sometimes he feels something inside of him that almost causes him to say unkind words. He needs to have his very nature changed and Jesus can do that, too.\n",

Then it cannot grow again. Just so it is with that old nature of ours. It needs to be taken out of us.

It also encourages believers to persevere in their faith and to hold fast to the hope that they have in Christ. It contains many important teachings on topics such as faith, salvation, and the priesthood of Christ. It is a valuable book for any Christian to study and meditate on.\"}"

Soon he disobeys his parents; and when he goes to school, perhaps he takes things which belong to others, or is unkind to his playmates.
